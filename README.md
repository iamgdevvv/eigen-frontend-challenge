## **API Endpoints**

The project includes an API endpoint at

```
/api/algoritma
```

that provides a range of algorithmic challenges. The endpoint is implemented in app/routes/api.algoritma.ts and includes the following challenges:

- case1: Reverses the alphabet of a given string while keeping numbers at the end.
- case2: Finds the longest word in a given sentence.
- case3: Counts the occurrences of each word in a given query array within a given input array.
- case4: Calculates the difference between the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals of a given matrix.

- Routing: The application uses React Router to manage server-side routing.
- News API Integration: The application fetches data from the News API with server-side loader.
- Responsive Design: The application uses antd and Tailwind CSS to implement a responsive design.
- /api/algoritma Endpoint: The application provides a range of algorithmic challenges at /api/algoritma.
